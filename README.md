# Data Process
1.To prepare the output results for both the small and large models, you can save the results in .txt files. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to structure and save the outputs:
Run both the small and large models on your dataset.
Ensure that each model's output (e.g., predictions, probabilities, bounding boxes) is captured.

2.Runing data_process/label_img.py, get_confidence_threshold.py, get_predict_number_area.py.

3.Runing data_prepare_for_liner.py
